# TwitterHunter
Compare two subjects similarity using twitter

- Using basic Webscraping and GUI modules
  - scrape recent tweets on the user inputted subjects
  
- Use common words file to weed out irrelevant words, collect common hashtags and analyze frequency of tweets
- Used sets to find common words between files

- hunt.py defines the GUI object

  
- Need to update/create more sophisticated algorithm for comparing subject matter
- Need to get more tweets per subject
